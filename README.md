# **Ensemble-Model**

Overview Ensemble models is a machine learning approach to combine multiple other models in the prediction process. Those models are referred to as base estimators. It is a solution to overcome the following technical challenges of building a single estimator: High variance: The model is very sensitive to the provided inputs to the learned features. Low accuracy: One model or one algorithm to fit the entire training data might not be good enough to meet expectations. Features noise and bias: The model relies heavily on one or a few features while making a prediction.

# **Ensemble Algorithm**
A single algorithm may not make the perfect prediction for a given dataset. Machine learning algorithms have their limitations and producing a model with high accuracy is challenging. If we build and combine multiple models, the overall accuracy could get boosted. The combination can be implemented by aggregating the output from each model with two objectives: reducing the model error and maintaining its generalization. The way to implement such aggregation can be achieved using some techniques. Some textbooks refer to such architecture as meta-algorithms.
