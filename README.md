# Ensemble-Model
Overview Ensemble models is a machine learning approach to combine multiple other models in the prediction process. Those models are referred to as base estimators. It is a solution to overcome the following technical challenges of building a single estimator: High variance: The model is very sensitive to the provided inputs to the learned features. Low accuracy: One model or one algorithm to fit the entire training data might not be good enough to meet expectations. Features noise and bias: The model relies heavily on one or a few features while making a prediction.
